// Other libc++ headers use <climits> but libc++'s <climits> complains if it
// thinks <limits.h> is not its own wrapper, which we do not need.  We always
// get the kernel's <limits.h> before the libc++ with the way the include paths
// are set up, which is necessary because of other headers where preempting
// libc++'s header is unavoidable for the kernel environment.

#include <limits.h>
